2. Create `.env` file:

```

3. Configure environment variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` - GenLayer Football Betting contract address
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_GENLAYER_RPC_URL` - GenLayer RPC URL (defaults to `https://studio-next.genlayer.com/api`)

disconnect preference. Private keys are never stored by the application.
