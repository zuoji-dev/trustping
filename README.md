## About
This project includes the boilerplate code for a GenLayer use case implementation, specifically a football bets game.

## Branching

See [docs/BRANCHING.md](docs/BRANCHING.md) for the release-train model used by
this repo.

## What's included
- An example intelligent contract (Football Bets) with web access and LLM integration
- **Direct mode tests** — fast, in-memory unit tests with web/LLM mocking (~ms per test)
- **Integration tests** — full end-to-end tests against GenLayer Studio
- **Contract linting** — static analysis to catch common contract issues before deployment
- **CI pipeline** — GitHub Actions workflow for linting and direct tests
- A production-ready Next.js 15 frontend with TypeScript, TanStack Query, and Radix UI
- Configuration file template and deployment scripts

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.12
- [GenLayer CLI](https://github.com/genlayerlabs/genlayer-cli) globally installed: `npm install -g genlayer`
- GenLayer Studio (for integration tests and deployment): Install from [Docs](https://docs.genlayer.com/developers/intelligent-contracts/tooling-setup#using-the-genlayer-studio) or use the hosted [GenLayer Studio](https://studio.genlayer.com/)

## Quick Start

### 1. Set up Python environment

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Lint your contracts

Run the GenVM linter to catch issues before deployment:

```shell
genvm-lint check contracts/football_bets.py
```

The linter catches:
- Forbidden imports and non-deterministic calls
- Invalid storage types (must use `TreeMap`, `DynArray`, `u256`, etc.)
- Missing decorators and return type annotations
- Non-deterministic operations outside equivalence principle blocks
- And [20+ other rules](https://github.com/genlayerlabs/genvm-linter)

### 3. Run direct mode tests

Direct mode tests run contracts in-memory without needing GenLayer Studio. They use mocks for web requests and LLM calls, giving you fast feedback (~milliseconds per test):

```shell
pytest tests/direct/ -v
```

Direct mode features used in these tests:
- `direct_deploy("contracts/file.py")` — deploy contract in memory
- `direct_vm.sender = address` — set transaction sender
- `direct_vm.mock_web(pattern, response)` — mock HTTP/render calls
- `direct_vm.mock_llm(pattern, response)` — mock LLM responses
- `direct_vm.expect_revert("message")` — assert expected failures
- `direct_vm.clear_mocks()` — reset mocks between calls

### 4. Deploy the contract

1. Choose your network: `genlayer network`
2. Deploy: `genlayer deploy` (runs the script in `/deploy/deployScript.ts`)

### 5. Run integration tests

Integration tests deploy the contract to GenLayer Studio and test with real consensus:

```shell
gltest tests/integration/ -v -s
```

These require GenLayer Studio running (local or hosted).

### 6. Set up the frontend

1. Copy `frontend/.env.example` to `frontend/.env`
2. Add your deployed contract address as `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
3. Run:

```shell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000/.

### Fee profile (developer suggestions)

The frontend uses published `@genlayer/transaction-kit` and
`@genlayer/transaction-kit-react` version `0.1.0-rc.2`, with `genlayer-js`
`2.0.0-rc.1`. Run `npm ci` from the repository root to install the locked releases.

The default network is Studio Next (Consensus v0.6) at
`https://studio-next.genlayer.com/api` (chain ID `61997`). Copy
`frontend/.env.example`; change the RPC URL and chain ID together when targeting
another deployment. Wallet, SDK, and Transaction Kit share this configuration.

Transaction Kit uses active network fee defaults. The checked-in
`frontend/fee-profile.json` is not wired into the application because measured
fees are specific to a contract build, GenVM version, and network. To use a
developer profile, regenerate it for your deployment and explicitly pass it as
`suggestions` to `createTransactionKit` in `frontend/lib/genlayer/kit.ts`.

Regenerate it with `npm run test:fees` while GenLayer Studio is running. The fee profile command estimates a trusted Studio fee preset from the active fee policy, runs the measured Football Bets deploy/create-bet scenario, and writes max-observed x 1.25 headroom as decimal strings.

Missing keys, such as time-unit allocations, fall back to network defaults.

## How the Football Bets Contract Works

1. **Creating Bets**: Users bet on a football match by providing the game date, teams, and predicted winner.
2. **Resolving Bets**: After the match, the contract fetches results from BBC Sport, uses an LLM to extract the score, and validates via the equivalence principle.
3. **Points**: Correct predictions earn points. Users can query their points or the leaderboard.

## Testing Strategy

| Test Type | Command | Speed | Requires Studio |
|-----------|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Lint** | `genvm-lint check contracts/*.py` | ~250ms | No |
| **Direct** | `pytest tests/direct/ -v` | ~ms/test | No |
| **Integration** | `gltest tests/integration/ -v -s` | ~min/test | Yes |

**Recommended workflow:**
1. Lint after every contract change
2. Run direct tests frequently during development
3. Run integration tests before deployment to verify consensus behavior

For AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.), the linter and direct tests provide the fast feedback loop needed for iterative development without requiring a running Studio instance.
